What is it? Is it a desktop app? is it a mobile app? is it a web app?

How does it work?

What concretely do I do? Can I try this right now from my phone?

How much does it cost?

What is their goal? Who is my counterparty.

## My Context



-------

# Key Points
- No workflow disruption - Claude Code runs on your machine
- Open source - MIT License
- End to end encryption
- Hands free mode with real time voice

# Features:

1. Zero workflow distribution 
    - Keep using your favorite tools, editors, and development environments
    exactly as before. Happy keeps the native Claude Code terminal experience while adding interaction on mobile.

2. Multiple Active Sessions
    - Run several Claude Code instances simultaneously across different
    projects. Switch between frontend, backend, and DevOps tasks without losing
    context or momentum.
3. Full console parity
    - Access all Claude Code features on your phone including terminal output,
    permissions, notifications, and mode switching.
4. Open source and Free 
    - Well organized codebase makes it easy to contribute. Friendly community.
5. Secure
    - Happy uses end to end encryption. No one can read your messages or code. You can deploy your own back relay server in 5 minutes.
6. Smart Push Notifications 
    - Get alerted when your input is needed, when code is ready to review, or when something went wrong.
7. Real-Time Voice Execution
    - Speak commands and watch them execute instantly. Not just transcription - true voice-to-action that lets you code, debug, and manage projects while completely hands-free.

# How does it work?

Start Happy CLI and you'll have a regular Claude Code session. But you can continue that same session from a mobile app [Download](/download) or web app (https://app.happy.engineering/).

Happy has three parts that work together:

1. CLI Program (happy)
    - This runs on your computer. It starts Claude Code and watches what it does. Then it encrypts this information and sends it to a server.

2. Mobile App
    - This runs on your phone. It gets the encrypted data from the server and shows you what Claude Code is doing. All the display code lives here.

3. Relay Server
    - This connects your computer and phone. It passes encrypted messages between them. The server can’t read your data. it just moves encrypted blobs around.


------------------------

Run a bunch of Claude Codes in parallel

Each Claude gets an isolated workspace. See who’s working, see who’s stuck, and what’s changed.



but none keep the native Claude Code terminal experience while allowing interaction outside the terminal, especially on mobile. On the other hand, tools like Vibetunnel or Termius replicate the terminal experience but lack push notifications, clean UIs for answering questions or viewing git diffs, and easy setup.

We wanted our integration to fully mirror the native Claude Code experience, including terminal output, permissions, notifications, and mode switching.
