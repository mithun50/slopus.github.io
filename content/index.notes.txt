# Welcome Page Content Notes

## Core Concept
Happy Coder is a platform that lets you run Claude Code from anywhere - your phone, tablet, or any device with a browser. Unlike cloud-based solutions, Happy Coder runs Claude Code on machines YOU control and own.

## Key Differentiators from Terragon and Similar Services

### You Own the Infrastructure
- Terragon: Rents machines on your behalf, charges for compute time, runs on their infrastructure
- Happy Coder: Runs on YOUR machines - desktop, laptop, homelab, VPS, Raspberry Pi, or any internet-connected computer
- Complete control over hardware, OS, environment, dependencies, and configurations

### Use Cases Enabled by Self-Hosting
- Run on specialized or esoteric hardware (GPUs, ARM devices, custom builds)
- Work with air-gapped or high-security environments
- Use custom development environments and toolchains
- Integrate with internal systems behind firewalls
- Experiment and hack without cloud costs or restrictions
- Run multiple concurrent sessions across different machines

## Technical Architecture

### Three Core Components

1. **CLI Program (happy)**
   - Runs on your computer alongside Claude Code
   - Monitors and captures Claude Code's actions and outputs
   - Encrypts all data before transmission
   - Maintains full local control over code execution

2. **Mobile/Web Interface**
   - Access from phone, tablet, or any browser
   - Receives encrypted data stream from your machine
   - Full console parity - every Claude Code feature works
   - Real-time synchronization with your local session
   - Voice commands and smart notifications

3. **Relay Server**
   - Simple message broker between your devices
   - Only handles encrypted blobs - cannot read your code or data
   - End-to-end encryption ensures privacy
   - Open source and self-hostable if desired

## Key Features

### Zero Workflow Distribution
- Keep your existing development setup exactly as-is
- No need to change editors, tools, or environments
- Happy integrates seamlessly without disruption

### Multiple Active Sessions
- Run several Claude Code instances simultaneously
- Switch between different projects and contexts
- Manage frontend, backend, DevOps tasks in parallel
- Each session runs on the machine you choose

### Full Console Parity
- Every Claude Code feature available on mobile
- Plan mode, custom agents, all commands work
- True mobile development, not just monitoring

### Open Source and Free
- Complete transparency in how it works
- Active community and contribution-friendly codebase
- No subscription fees or usage charges
- Self-host everything if you prefer

### Security Through Encryption
- End-to-end encryption for all data transmission
- Your code never leaves your machines unencrypted
- Relay server cannot access your content
- Complete privacy and control

### Smart Push Notifications
- Get alerted when input is needed
- Notifications when code is ready for review
- Error and completion alerts
- Stay productive without constant monitoring

### Real-Time Voice Execution
- Voice commands execute instantly
- Not just transcription - actual voice-to-action
- Code, debug, and manage projects hands-free
- Perfect for mobile productivity

## Getting Started Flow

1. Install Happy CLI on your development machine
2. Start a Claude Code session through Happy
3. Connect from mobile app or web interface
4. Continue working from anywhere

## Primary Use Cases

- **Mobile Development**: Start tasks on desktop, review/continue on phone
- **Remote Work**: Access your home/office machine from anywhere
- **Team Collaboration**: Share sessions securely with teammates
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Monitor and control builds/tests remotely
- **Experimentation**: Run Claude Code on various hardware configurations
- **Security-First Environments**: Keep code on your infrastructure

## Value Propositions

1. **Freedom**: Run on any hardware you own
2. **Control**: Your machines, your rules, your data
3. **Flexibility**: Adapt to any development workflow
4. **Cost**: No cloud charges, just your own infrastructure
5. **Privacy**: End-to-end encryption, self-hostable
6. **Productivity**: Work from anywhere without compromises
