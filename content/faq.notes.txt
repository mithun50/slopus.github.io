## Detailed Technical Answers (Before Simplification)

### Does Claude Code have an app?
Yes! Claude Code has a mobile companion app called "Happy Coder" that allows developers to control Claude Code remotely from their mobile devices. The setup involves:
1. Installing the Happy Coder mobile app from App Store/Google Play
2. Installing the `happy-coder` NPM package on your computer
3. Running `happy` command on your computer to start the relay
4. Scanning a QR code to connect your phone to your computer's Claude Code session

The connection is end-to-end encrypted and allows real-time synchronization between desktop CLI and mobile app.

### Can you use Claude on mobile?
Important distinction: Claude (the consumer AI chat product) is separate from Claude Code (the developer CLI tool).

For Claude: Yes, access claude.ai web interface on mobile browsers.

For Claude Code: Yes, through the Happy Coder mobile app which provides remote control of Claude Code running on your computer. This enables mobile coding workflows where you can start conversations on mobile, continue on desktop, and seamlessly handoff between devices.

### Can I do coding in a mobile app?
Yes, with the Happy Coder app you can absolutely do coding tasks on mobile. The app is designed for specific mobile-optimized coding workflows:
- Planning and brainstorming features during commutes
- Requesting code changes while away from desk
- Voice interaction for rubber duck debugging
- Reviewing Claude Code progress via push notifications
- Pre-sleep task seeding (setting up work for Claude Code to complete overnight)

The key insight is that mobile coding isn't about replicating desktop productivity, but using mobile for tasks it's good at (thinking, planning, exploration) while using desktop for what it's good at (precise editing, multi-monitor review).
