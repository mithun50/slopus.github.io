# Content Strategy for Happy Coder Documentation

## Target Audience
Developers who:
- Already pay $20-200/month for Claude Code
- Want to use Claude Code away from their desk
- Value privacy and open source
- Currently struggle with SSH/tmux/terminal apps on mobile
- Don't want vendor lock-in from VC-funded startups

## SEO Keywords to Target
Primary:
- "claude code mobile app"
- "claude code on phone"
- "control claude code remotely"
- "claude code iOS/Android"

Secondary:
- "claude code alternative to cursor mobile"
- "open source claude code client"
- "self hosted claude code"
- "claude code voice coding"
- "claude code MCP tools mobile"

Long-tail:
- "how to use claude code from phone"
- "claude code session from anywhere"
- "claude code without desktop"
- "claude code hands free coding"

## Content Priorities

### 1. Installation & Setup (HIGH PRIORITY - User Journey Start)
- Platform-specific guides with screenshots
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Self-hosting guide (differentiator!)

### 2. Use Cases & Workflows (HIGH PRIORITY - Demonstrate Value)
- Karl's home server automation story
- Voice coding while walking
- Pre-sleep task seeding
- Emergency debugging from phone

### 3. Comparisons (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Capture Comparison Searches)
- vs Omnara (they charge, we're free)
- vs Siteboon/ClaudeCodeUI (they host, we don't)
- vs Terragon (they control workflow, we don't)
- vs Cursor Mobile (they run VMs, we use your machine)
- vs SSH+tmux (we're purpose-built for Claude Code)

### 4. Technical Documentation (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Build Trust)
- Security/encryption details
- CLI reference
- Configuration options
- API documentation

### 5. Community (LOW PRIORITY - Future Growth)
- Contributing guide
- Plugin development
- Community showcases

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **True Extension, Not Replacement**: Happy extends your reach to YOUR machines, not cloud VMs
2. **Unix Philosophy**: One tool, one job, composable
3. **Zero Lock-in**: Open source, self-hostable, no proprietary workflow
4. **Privacy First**: End-to-end encryption, relay server can't read your code
5. **Free Forever**: No VC funding to chase, no pivot coming

## Content Voice
- Direct, no fluff (developers hate marketing speak)
- Technical but accessible (10th grade reading level per CLAUDE.md)
- Focus on solving real problems
- Use concrete examples (Karl's setup, Pavel's testimonial)
