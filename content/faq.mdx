# General FAQ 

## What does Happy Coder do?

Happy Coder is a mobile app that lets you control coding agents on many different computers from your phone.

## Is Happy Coder free?

Yes, completely free. No catches.

- **No usage limits** - Run as many sessions as you want
- **No user limits** - Install on all your devices
- **Open source (MIT)** - Fork it, modify it, learn from it

## Am I locked in?

No lock-in whatsoever. Here's why:

- **Open source** - The entire codebase is on GitHub
- **Self-hostable** - Run your own relay server
- **No account required** - No data to export or migrate
- **Works with vanilla Claude Code** - Not a proprietary wrapper

You can stop using Happy Coder instantly with zero changes to your workflow. Your Claude Code setup remains unchanged.

## What justifies your claim that Happy Coder is simple?

Happy Coder removes all the friction from mobile Claude Code access:

1. **No signup process** - Just download and run. No email verification, no account creation, no credit card. This is a real developer tool, not a SaaS product.

2. **Cross-platform by default** - Works on any computer (Mac, Windows, Linux) with any phone (iOS, Android). Control Claude Code on a Mac Mini from your Android phone. Run Claude Code on a Raspberry Pi and control it from your iPad.

3. **It just works** - Handles network issues gracefully. Reconnects automatically. Queues messages when offline. No broken SSH sessions or tmux corruption.

4. **Smart error handling** - Detects common problems and tells you exactly how to fix them. Port already in use? It tells you which process. Claude Code not found? It shows you where to install it.

5. **Unix philosophy** - Does one thing well: extends Claude Code to mobile. Doesn't try to be an IDE, a project manager, or a cloud platform.

We built Happy Coder after suffering through overly complicated platforms that promise everything but fail at basics. Simple tools that work beat complex tools that don't.

## Why is Happy Coder free and Open Source?

Three reasons:

**Privacy**: Your code is your business. With end-to-end encryption and open source code, you can verify that we can't see your work. No tracking, no data mining.

**Control**: You own your tools. Run your own relay server. Modify the code. Add features. Remove features. It's yours to shape as you need.

**Sustainability**: Open source projects can't rugpull you. When a VC-funded startup radically pivots or shuts down, you're stuck. Happy Coder will work as long as you want it to.

- Setting up coding tasks before bed (Claude Code works while you sleep!)
- Getting push notifications when code changes are ready

**Great desktop tasks:**
- Reviewing generated code with multiple windows
- Making precise edits with your full IDE
- Testing and debugging with all your tools

The magic is seamlessly switching between both in the same conversation.

## Security & Privacy Questions

### Can Happy Coder or the relay server see my code?

No. Everything is end-to-end encrypted:
- Encryption happens on your device before sending
- Relay server only sees encrypted blobs
- Only devices with the shared key can decrypt
- We literally cannot read your code even if we wanted to

Yes, Happy Coder is designed for enterprise use:
- End-to-end encryption protects your IP
- Self-host the relay server on your infrastructure
- No data ever touches our servers if self-hosted
- Open source code you can audit
- No analytics or telemetry

### What data does Happy Coder collect?

None. Zero. Nothing.
- No user accounts or emails
- No usage analytics
- No error reporting
- No telemetry
- No cookies or tracking

The only data that exists is encrypted blobs on the relay server, which we can't read.

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude Code not found" error

Happy Coder needs Claude Code installed first:
```bash
npm install -g claude-code
claude-code --version  # Verify installation
happy  # Now this should work
```

### QR code won't scan

Common fixes:
1. Increase screen brightness
2. Clean your camera lens
3. Make QR code bigger: `happy --qr-size large`
4. Use manual code: `happy --no-qr` (shows text code to type)

### "Port already in use" error

Another process is using port 8765:
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :8765

# Kill it
kill -9 [PID]

# Or use a different port
happy --port 8766
```

### Can't connect to relay server

Check if you're behind a corporate firewall:
1. Try using cellular data instead of WiFi
2. Ask IT to whitelist `relay.happy.engineering`
3. Or [self-host your relay server](/guides/self-hosting)
