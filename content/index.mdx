# Welcome

**Happy** lets you control **AI coding agents** from anywhere - your phone, tablet, or
web browser. The key difference from all those paid services? Happy those AI
coding agents runs on computers YOU own. Your desktop, laptop, server, or even a
Raspberry Pi. As long as it's connected to the internet, you can use Happy to
control Claude Code on that machine. Leave the house, fire off coding tasks and
come back to pull requests ready to review.

With Happy Coder you get:

- **Zero workflow disruption**: Run Claude Code on any computer you control. Use your custom setup, special hardware, or unique tools. No need to change how you work.
- **Work from anywhere**: Start coding on your desktop, then continue from your phone. Every Claude Code feature works on mobile: plan mode, custom agents, custom MCP servers, everything.
- **Multiple sessions**: Run several Claude Code instances at once. Have one working on your frontend while another handles backend tasks. Switch between them instantly.
- **End-to-end encryption**: Your code stays on your machines. Messages between your devices are encrypted.
- **No cloud costs**: Since you're using your own computers, there are no usage fees or subscriptions. Happy Coder is free and open source.

## Why Happy Coder?

Unlike cloud services that run code on rented machines, Happy Coder works with computers you already have. This means:

- Use any hardware you want
- Keep your exact development setup
- Work with private or secure systems
- No monthly bills or usage limits
- Complete control over your environment

Whether you're hacking on a personal project, working with specialized hardware, or just want to check on long-running tasks from your phone, Happy Coder gives you freedom to work your way.
