# Known Issues

- Voice agent loses conversation context after long conversation.
- Voice agent costs about $8/hour. Not sure if this is too high for most people. Its currently a prototype.
- Claude code will automatically compact the context of a session. If you keep
using the same session on the mobile app and keep asking for changes, eventually
you will reach a point where claude starts to get confused. Currently is no
indication in the mobile app that compaction ran, so it can be surprising.
