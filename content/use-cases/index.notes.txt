# Use Cases

How developers actually use Happy Coder to control Claude Code from their phones.


## Emergency Debugging from Anywhere

You're at dinner. Your phone buzzes - production is down. Instead of rushing home:

1. Open Happy Coder on your phone
2. Connect to your work machine's Claude Code session
3. Tell Claude: "Check the logs for the API error in the last hour"
4. Claude investigates while you finish dessert
5. Review the fix on your phone, approve the changes

Real example from Pavel:
> "Was at my kid's soccer game when our API started throwing 500s. Used Happy to have Claude Code check the logs, identify the bad deploy, and roll back. Fixed in 10 minutes without leaving the field."



## Async Code Reviews

Review and guide Claude Code's work during "dead time."

**On the train:**
- Check Claude's progress on refactoring
- Review the approach
- Suggest adjustments
- Claude implements while you commute

**In waiting rooms:**
- Queue up the next set of tests to write
- Review Claude's test coverage
- Add edge cases you just thought of

**During meetings (we've all been there):**
- Quietly guide Claude through bug fixes
- Review small PRs
- Plan the next sprint's technical tasks

## Multi-Machine Development

Control Claude Code on all your machines from one phone.

**Common setups:**
- MacBook for development
- Linux server for deployment testing  
- Windows VM for cross-platform checks
- Raspberry Pi for IoT projects

```bash
# Start sessions on each machine
happy --session-name "macbook-dev"    # On MacBook
happy --session-name "linux-deploy"   # On Linux server
happy --session-name "windows-test"   # On Windows VM

# Switch between them instantly on your phone
```

Real developer quote: "I have Claude Code running on three machines. I switch between them on my phone like browser tabs."

## Team Collaboration Patterns

How teams use Happy Coder together.

### Architecture Discussions
- Start Claude Code session during design meeting
- Have Claude generate example implementations
- Team reviews on phones while discussing
- Iterate on designs with immediate code examples

## CI/CD Integration

Trigger Claude Code from your CI pipeline, monitor from your phone.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ai-review.yml
- name: AI Code Review
  run: |
    happy --headless --session-name "pr-${{ github.event.number }}"
    claude-code review --pr ${{ github.event.number }}
```

Get notifications on your phone when Claude finishes reviewing PRs.



### The Context Switcher
Working on multiple projects? Keep them all going:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Personal project
happy --session personal-blog

# Terminal 2: Work project  
happy --session work-api

# Terminal 3: Open source contribution
happy --session oss-contrib

# Switch between all three from your phone
```

## Accessibility Wins

Happy Coder helps developers with different needs:

### RSI/Carpal Tunnel Relief
- Use voice coding to rest your hands
- Review code on phone with minimal typing
- Guide Claude verbally instead of typing prompts

### ADHD-Friendly Workflows
- Capture ideas immediately when they strike
- Work in short bursts from anywhere
- Change physical locations while maintaining context

### Remote Work Enhancement
- Code from coffee shops without lugging laptop
- Emergency fixes from anywhere
- Better work-life balance with mobile flexibility

## The "Real" Use Cases

Let's be honest about what developers actually do:

### The 11 PM Anxiety Fix
Can't sleep thinking about that bug? Tell Claude to investigate. Either it finds something (you were right!) or it doesn't (you can sleep now).

### The Meeting Escape
Stuck in a pointless meeting? Queue up real work for Claude. At least something productive happens.

### The Procrastination Productivity
Don't feel like coding but need progress? Describe what you want to Claude from your couch. Sometimes starting is the hardest part.

### The Imposter Syndrome Helper
Worried your approach is wrong? Talk it through with Claude via voice while walking. Often you know more than you think.

## Getting Started with Use Cases

Try these beginner-friendly workflows:

1. **Evening Planning**: Before bed, describe tomorrow's first task to Claude
2. **Morning Review**: Check what Claude built overnight while having coffee
3. **Lunch Break Coding**: Quick fixes during lunch without opening laptop
4. **Weekend Experiments**: Try new ideas from the couch

Remember: Happy Coder isn't about coding on your phone. It's about controlling Claude Code from anywhere, maintaining momentum, and capturing ideas when they strike.
