## Karl's Home Automation Setup

Karl runs Claude Code on a Mac Mini in his basement. He uses Happy Coder to control it from anywhere in his house.

**The Problem:** Karl needed Claude Code available on-demand for home automation tasks, but keeping it running 24/7 was expensive. His cron job that restarted Claude Code every 5 minutes was burning through his usage limits.

**The Solution:** Now Karl starts Claude Code sessions from his phone only when needed. He uses MCP tools to:
- Control his Windows VM for testing Electron apps
- Take screenshots of running applications
- Deploy builds from staging to production
- Run automated tests across different OSes

**The Result:** 90% reduction in Claude Code usage costs. Full control of his development pipeline from his couch.

```bash
# Karl's setup on Mac Mini
happy --dir ~/automation --mcp-config ~/mcp-tools.json

# From his phone, he can now:
# - Start Windows VM
# - Test Electron app installation
# - Take screenshots for verification
# - Promote builds to stable
```
