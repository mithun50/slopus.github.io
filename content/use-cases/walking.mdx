## Voice Coding While Walking

Perfect for when you need to think through problems away from your desk.

**Morning Walk Workflow:**
```
You: "Hey Claude, I'm thinking about refactoring our auth system.
     The JWT tokens are getting too complex."

Voice Agent: "I'll help you plan that refactoring. Let me understand
             the current setup first..."

[30 minutes of back-and-forth while walking]

You: "Great, implement the token service we discussed."

[Get home to find the refactor ready for review]
```

The voice agent translates your casual speech into proper Claude Code prompts. You think out loud, it handles the details.
